# Specify public participant cancellation flow

Define normative API, frontend, data, and EARS requirements for participant-driven cancellation using booking cancellation links/tokens so cancellation is no longer deferred.


## Notes

**2026-02-23T20:18:38Z**

Added normative public participant cancellation specs across EARS + NL split/unified specs, removed cancellation deferral note, and ran selfci check (pass).
