# Display conflict error message on booking slot conflict

When a 409 (slot_unavailable) response is returned from POST /api/book, the app returns to slot selection without displaying a user-facing error message like 'no longer available' or 'choose another time'. The user gets no feedback that their booking failed due to a conflict — the UI silently navigates back. The app should display a visible conflict error message before/when returning to the slot selection step.
