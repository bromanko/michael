# Timezone change on availability confirm step should not re-call Gemini

When the user changes the timezone on the 'here's what I understood' confirmation step, the app re-submits to Gemini for re-parsing. The parsed windows already have absolute ISO-8601 timestamps with offsets — changing the display timezone should just convert them client-side via JavaScript's Intl API, not re-parse natural language.
