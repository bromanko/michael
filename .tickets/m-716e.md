# Add stable id attributes to all booking flow buttons

EARS spec AGT-001 requires every interactive element to have a stable id attribute. Black-box Playwright testing found that submit buttons (OK, Find slots, Looks good, Confirm booking) lack id attributes. The title input has id="title-input" and the custom duration input has id="custom-duration-input", but buttons do not follow this pattern.

Add id attributes to all buttons in the booking flow View module. Suggested pattern: step-specific prefixes like "title-submit-btn", "duration-submit-btn", "duration-back-btn", "duration-15-btn", etc.
