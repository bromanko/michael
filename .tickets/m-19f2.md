# Add double-booking protection

Two concurrent POST /api/book requests for the same time slot both succeed. No database-level overlap constraint and no application-level check-then-insert within a transaction. Need to verify slot availability within a transaction before inserting a booking.


## Notes

**2026-02-08T19:34:20Z**

Spec-writing phase surfaced this as a concrete bug: /api/book does not perform booking-time slot revalidation and may allow stale-slot/double-booking under race conditions.
