# Add CSRF protection to API endpoints

All three POST endpoints (/api/parse, /api/slots, /api/book) lack CSRF tokens. Any site can trigger requests if a user has the app open. Requires backend work (generate token via cookie or meta tag) and frontend work (send token as request header in Api.elm).
