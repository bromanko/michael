# Add declarative database migration system

Set up a declarative database migration system for managing SQLite schema changes. Evaluate existing tools (e.g. Atlas, dbmate, goose) that support a declarative approach where you define the desired schema state and the tool computes the diff. Must integrate with the Nix-based dev environment and support SQLite.
