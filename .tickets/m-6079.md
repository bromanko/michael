# Humanize booking emails to sound personal

The confirmation and cancellation emails currently read like automated service notifications ('Your meeting has been confirmed', 'This is an automated message from Michael'). Since the from address is the host's own email, the tone should match — warm, personal, first-person. E.g. 'Looking forward to it! Here are the details...' rather than 'Your meeting has been confirmed.' This ticket covers rewriting the email body templates in Email.fs (buildConfirmationEmailContent, buildCancellationEmailContent) and updating the corresponding tests in EmailTests.fs. Depends on the email notifications plan (docs/plan-email-notifications.md) being implemented first.
