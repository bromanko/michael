# TypeScript Performance Review


Analyze TypeScript code for performance issues, focusing on JavaScript runtime behavior, allocation patterns, async throughput, and UI rendering efficiency (when applicable).

## Scope Determination

First, determine what code to review:

1. **If the user specifies files/directories**: Review those paths
2. **If no scope specified**: Review working changes
   - Check for `.jj` directory first, use `jj diff` if present
   - Otherwise use `git diff` to identify changed `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, and `.cts` files
   - If no changes, ask the user what to review

## Review Process

1. **Identify hot paths**: Request handlers, tight loops, high-frequency render paths, data transforms
2. **Analyze allocation and async flow**
3. **Check runtime-specific patterns** below
4. **Output findings** in the standard format

## Performance Checklist

### Algorithmic Complexity
- Avoids accidental O(n²)/O(n³) in loops and nested searches
- Uses appropriate data structures (`Map`/`Set` vs arrays for lookups)
- Avoids repeated full scans when indexing/caching would help
- Pagination/streaming used for large collections

### Allocation & GC Pressure
- Avoids unnecessary object/array recreation in hot paths
- Uses in-place updates only when safe and justified
- Avoids heavy cloning (`{...obj}` / deep copies) inside tight loops
- Reuses expensive objects where practical
- Minimizes temporary allocations in parser/transform pipelines

### Async & Concurrency
- Independent async work runs concurrently (`Promise.all`) where safe
- Avoids accidental serial awaits in loops
- Handles backpressure/concurrency limits for large fan-out tasks
- Timeouts/retries are bounded to avoid runaway resource usage
- No blocking CPU-heavy work on event-loop-critical paths

### Rendering & UI (if React/TSX present)
- Avoids unnecessary re-renders from unstable props/callbacks
- Correct use of memoization (`memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) where beneficial
- Large lists use virtualization/windowing
- Derived values computed efficiently and cached when expensive
- Effects avoid redundant work due to dependency mistakes

### Data Parsing & Serialization
- JSON parsing/stringifying not repeated unnecessarily
- Schema validation scoped to boundaries, not repeated in deep layers
- Large payload transforms use streaming/chunking where possible
- Regex usage avoids catastrophic backtracking and repeated recompilation

### I/O & External Calls
- Batches network/database requests when possible
- Avoids N+1 request/query patterns
- Caching strategy considered for frequently requested data
- Connection reuse/pooling configured through libraries/frameworks

## Output Format

Present findings as:

```markdown
## Findings

### [SEVERITY] Issue Title
**File:** `path/to/file.ts:LINE`
**Category:** performance

**Issue:** Description of the performance concern and its impact.

**Suggestion:** How to optimize, with code example if helpful.

**Effort:** trivial|small|medium|large

---
```

Use severity indicators:
- HIGH: Major bottlenecks, unbounded growth, event-loop blocking risks
- MEDIUM: Suboptimal patterns with measurable overhead
- LOW: Minor optimizations and cleanup opportunities

## Summary

After all findings, provide:
- Total count by severity
- Top bottlenecks to address
- Hot paths identified
- Overall performance assessment (1-2 sentences)

**Required:** End your response with exactly one status marker on its own line:
- `[STATUS: success]` — no HIGH or MEDIUM findings
- `[STATUS: fail]` and `[FAILURE_REASON: <list of HIGH/MEDIUM findings>]` — one or more HIGH or MEDIUM findings exist
