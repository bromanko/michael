# Elm Performance Review


Analyze Elm code for performance issues, focusing on virtual DOM rendering, lazy evaluation, efficient data handling, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

## Scope Determination

First, determine what code to review:

1. **If the user specifies files/directories**: Review those paths
2. **If no scope specified**: Review working changes
   - Check for `.jj` directory first, use `jj diff` if present
   - Otherwise use `git diff` to identify changed `.elm` files
   - If no changes, ask the user what to review

## Review Process

1. **Identify hot paths**: Find frequently re-rendered views, large update cycles, expensive computations
2. **Analyze data flow**: Track how data moves through Model/update/view
3. **Check rendering patterns** below
4. **Review data structure choices**
5. **Output findings** in the standard format

## Performance Checklist

### Virtual DOM & Rendering
- `Html.Lazy.lazy` used for expensive view functions that don't change often
- `Html.Lazy.lazy2`/`lazy3` used with stable reference arguments
- `Html.Keyed.node` used for lists where items are reordered, added, or removed
- Avoid recreating view structures unnecessarily (e.g., inline anonymous functions in event handlers)
- Large lists use keyed nodes to avoid full re-render
- View functions that depend on a small subset of Model receive only what they need

### Model Design
- Model is not a single deeply nested record (causes full equality checks)
- Frequently changing data separated from stable data in Model
- Avoid storing derived/computed data in Model (compute in view instead, or use `Html.Lazy`)
- Consider breaking large Model into focused sub-models for `Html.Lazy` effectiveness
- Avoid `Dict` with thousands of entries if only a few are displayed at a time

### Update Function
- `update` returns same Model reference when nothing changed (enables `Html.Lazy` skipping)
- Avoid unnecessary record updates (`{ model | field = model.field }`)
- Batch related state changes in a single `update` branch
- `Cmd.batch` used to combine commands, not chained updates
- Avoid cascading messages (Msg triggers another Msg triggers another) — flatten when possible

### Data Structures
- `Dict` used for key-based lookups instead of `List.filter` / `List.find`
- `Set` used for membership tests instead of `List.member`
- `Array` used when index-based access is needed
- Avoid `List.length` in conditionals (O(n)) — track count in Model if needed
- Avoid `List.reverse` after `List.foldl` when `List.foldr` would suffice (or vice versa)
- Avoid rebuilding large data structures on every update

### JSON Decoding
- Decoders are not doing unnecessary work
- Large JSON payloads decoded into efficient structures (Dict, not List of pairs)
- `Decode.lazy` used for recursive decoders
- Avoid re-decoding data that hasn't changed

### Subscriptions
- Subscriptions are stable references (avoid recreating on every call)
- High-frequency subscriptions (animation frames, mouse moves) do minimal work
- `Sub.batch` used efficiently
- Inactive subscriptions return `Sub.none` rather than filtering events in update

### String & List Operations
- String concatenation uses `++` sparingly in loops — consider `String.join` or `String.concat`
- `List.map` / `List.filter` chains consolidated where possible
- Avoid multiple passes over the same list — use `List.foldl` for single-pass operations
- `String.fromInt` / `String.fromFloat` not called repeatedly for the same value

### HTTP & Commands
- Requests are not duplicated (debouncing for user input, deduplication for data fetching)
- Large responses handled appropriately (pagination, streaming if possible via ports)
- Loading states prevent redundant requests
- Failed requests don't trigger infinite retry loops

### Ports & JavaScript Interop
- Port messages are as small as necessary
- Avoid sending entire Model through ports
- High-frequency port communication batched where possible
- Large data transfers through ports use efficient serialization

## Output Format

Present findings as:

```markdown
## Findings

### [SEVERITY] Issue Title
**File:** `path/to/Module.elm:LINE`
**Category:** performance

**Issue:** Description of the performance concern and its impact.

**Suggestion:** How to optimize, with code example if helpful.

**Effort:** trivial|small|medium|large

---
```

Use severity indicators:
- HIGH: Significant bottleneck, unbounded growth, rendering performance issues
- MEDIUM: Suboptimal patterns, unnecessary overhead
- LOW: Minor optimizations, micro-improvements

## Summary

After all findings, provide:
- Total count by severity
- Top bottlenecks to address
- Hot paths identified
- Architecture recommendations (if applicable)
- Overall performance assessment (1-2 sentences)

**Required:** End your response with exactly one status marker on its own line:
- `[STATUS: success]` — no HIGH or MEDIUM findings
- `[STATUS: fail]` and `[FAILURE_REASON: <list of HIGH/MEDIUM findings>]` — one or more HIGH or MEDIUM findings exist
