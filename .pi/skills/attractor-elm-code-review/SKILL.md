# Elm Code Review


Perform a thorough code quality review of Elm code, focusing on idiomatic patterns, The Elm Architecture, and clean module design.

## Scope Determination

First, determine what code to review:

1. **If the user specifies files/directories**: Review those paths
2. **If no scope specified**: Review working changes
   - Check for `.jj` directory first, use `jj diff` if present
   - Otherwise use `git diff` to identify changed `.elm` files
   - If no changes, ask the user what to review

## Review Process

1. **Read the target files** using the Read tool
2. **Analyze against the checklist** below
3. **Output findings** in the standard format

## Review Checklist

### The Elm Architecture (TEA)
- `Model` represents the full application/component state clearly
- `Msg` type captures all possible user and system events
- `Msg` variants are specific (not catch-all like `NoOp` overuse)
- `update` function handles all `Msg` cases meaningfully
- `view` is a pure function of `Model`
- No business logic in `view` — only presentation
- `Cmd` and `Sub` used correctly for side effects
- `init` sets up reasonable default state

### Type Design
- Custom types model domain states explicitly (avoid stringly-typed code)
- Opaque types used to hide implementation details in exposed modules
- Type aliases used for records to improve readability
- Impossible states made impossible through type design
- Phantom types or extensible records used where appropriate
- Avoid overly generic types when specific types would be clearer

### Pattern Matching
- `case` expressions are exhaustive (compiler enforces this, but watch for lazy `_ ->` catch-alls)
- Pattern matching preferred over nested `if/then/else`
- Destructuring used effectively in function arguments and `let` bindings
- Complex patterns broken into helper functions for readability

### Pipeline & Composition
- Pipeline operator (`|>`) used for data transformations
- Function composition (`>>`) used where it aids clarity
- Pipelines read top-to-bottom as a clear sequence of operations
- Avoid excessively long pipelines (break into named intermediate values)

### Maybe/Result Handling
- No `Maybe.withDefault` that silently discards important `Nothing` cases
- `Result` used for operations that can fail with meaningful errors
- `Maybe.map` / `Result.map` chains used instead of nested `case` expressions
- `Maybe.andThen` / `Result.andThen` for chaining fallible operations
- Avoid `Maybe` when a custom type with explicit states would be clearer

### Module Organization
- Exposed functions form a clear, minimal API (`exposing` list is intentional)
- Related functionality grouped in same module
- Module names reflect their purpose
- `exposing (..)` avoided in imports (prefer explicit imports)
- Module boundaries align with domain concepts
- No circular dependencies

### Naming Conventions
- Functions use `camelCase`
- Types use `PascalCase`
- Module names use `PascalCase` with dot separators
- Names are descriptive but not overly verbose
- Boolean functions prefixed appropriately (e.g., `isValid`, `hasItems`)
- `Msg` variants use verb form (e.g., `ClickedButton`, `ReceivedResponse`)

### JSON Decoders/Encoders
- Decoders validate data at the boundary
- Decoder pipelines are clear and readable
- Error messages in decoders are helpful
- Encoders match expected API format
- Optional fields handled explicitly (`Decode.maybe` vs `Decode.field`)

### Code Clarity
- Functions are focused (single responsibility)
- Complex logic has explanatory comments
- No dead code or unused imports
- Consistent formatting (elm-format applied)
- `let` bindings used to name intermediate values for clarity

## Output Format

Present findings as:

```markdown
## Findings

### [SEVERITY] Issue Title
**File:** `path/to/Module.elm:LINE`
**Category:** quality

**Issue:** Description of what's wrong and why it matters.

**Suggestion:** How to fix, with code example if helpful.

**Effort:** trivial|small|medium|large

---
```

Use severity indicators:
- HIGH: Bugs, incorrect behavior, serious maintainability issues
- MEDIUM: Non-idiomatic code, unclear patterns, missing error handling
- LOW: Style issues, minor improvements, optional enhancements

## Summary

After all findings, provide:
- Total count by severity
- Top 2-3 priority items to address
- Overall code quality assessment (1-2 sentences)

**Required:** End your response with exactly one status marker on its own line:
- `[STATUS: success]` — no HIGH or MEDIUM findings
- `[STATUS: fail]` and `[FAILURE_REASON: <list of HIGH/MEDIUM findings>]` — one or more HIGH or MEDIUM findings exist
