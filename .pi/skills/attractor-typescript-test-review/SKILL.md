# TypeScript Test Review

**Action required:** Run `/review typescript test` to start an interactive test review. Do not perform the review manually.

---

<!-- The content below is used by the /review command as review instructions -->

Analyze TypeScript test code for coverage gaps, edge case handling, test quality, and framework-appropriate testing practices.

## Scope Determination

First, determine what to review:

1. **If the user specifies test files**: Review those paths
2. **If the user specifies source files**: Find corresponding tests and review coverage
3. **If no scope specified**: Review working changes
   - Check for `.jj` directory first, use `jj diff` if present
   - Otherwise use `git diff` to identify changed files
   - Look at both changed source and test files

Test files are commonly `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, or under `__tests__/`.

## Review Process

1. **Map source to tests**: Identify modules/features lacking meaningful coverage
2. **Analyze scenario coverage**: happy path, failure path, boundary conditions
3. **Review test quality** using checklist below
4. **Output findings** in the standard format

## Test Review Checklist

### Coverage Gaps
- Public behavior and critical business logic are tested
- Error and exception paths are covered
- Boundary and edge cases covered (empty, nullish, large inputs, invalid formats)
- Authorization/permission-sensitive logic has explicit tests
- Integration boundaries (DB/API/file/network) have representative tests

### Test Quality
- Tests verify behavior, not private implementation details
- Names describe intent clearly
- Assertions are specific and meaningful
- Tests are deterministic (no timing/race flakiness)
- Setup and teardown are explicit and isolated
- No hidden inter-test dependencies

### Skipped & Disabled Tests
- Flag any use of `it.skip`, `test.skip`, `describe.skip`, `xit`, `xdescribe`, `xtest`, or `test.todo` — especially if recently added
- Look for tests with trivially passing assertions or empty bodies (a sign the test was gutted to pass)
- Check for commented-out tests or `expect(true).toBe(true)` placeholder assertions
- Watch for `TODO`/`FIXME` comments suggesting the test was too hard to fix and was bypassed instead
- These patterns are **HIGH severity** when they appear to be workarounds (e.g., an LLM disabling a test it couldn't fix rather than addressing the underlying failure)

### Type-Driven Test Practices
- Test fixtures align with actual TypeScript types
- `as any` in tests minimized and justified
- Mocks/stubs preserve contract shape to avoid false confidence
- Runtime validators tested when used for untrusted input

### Framework Patterns (Jest/Vitest/Playwright/etc.)
- Avoids over-mocking that removes behavior under test
- Uses fake timers carefully and restores state
- Async tests await all promises and assert rejection paths
- Snapshot tests are focused and reviewed (not overly broad)
- E2E tests focus on critical flows and failure cases, not only happy paths

### Edge Cases & Robustness
- Empty collections/strings, null/undefined, malformed input
- Concurrency/race scenarios where relevant
- Retry/timeout/fallback behavior tested
- Idempotency and duplicate request handling tested where applicable
- Error mapping and user-visible failure responses validated

### Property-Based / Fuzz Opportunities
Identify logic that would benefit from generated input testing:
- Parsers, validators, normalizers
- Serialization/deserialization roundtrip behavior
- Business invariants over wide input spaces

## Output Format

Present findings as:

```markdown
## Findings

### [SEVERITY] Issue Title
**File:** `path/to/file.test.ts:LINE` (or source file if missing tests)
**Category:** testing

**Issue:** Description of the testing gap or quality issue.

**Suggestion:** What to test or how to improve, with example if helpful.

**Effort:** trivial|small|medium|large

---
```

Use severity indicators:
- HIGH: Critical untested paths, missing failure/security tests
- MEDIUM: Important edge cases missing, weak assertions
- LOW: Organization and incremental quality improvements

## Summary

After all findings, provide:
- Total count by severity
- Coverage summary (areas with/without adequate tests)
- Top testing priorities
- Overall test suite assessment (1-2 sentences)
