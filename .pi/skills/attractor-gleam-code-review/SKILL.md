# Gleam Code Review

**Action required:** Run `/review gleam code` to start an interactive code quality review. Do not perform the review manually.

---

<!-- The content below is used by the /review command as review instructions -->

Perform a thorough code quality review of Gleam code, focusing on idiomatic patterns, proper error handling, and clean architecture.

## Scope Determination

First, determine what code to review:

1. **If the user specifies files/directories**: Review those paths
2. **If no scope specified**: Review working changes
   - Check for `.jj` directory first, use `jj diff` if present
   - Otherwise use `git diff` to identify changed `.gleam` files
   - If no changes, ask the user what to review

## Review Process

1. **Read the target files** using the Read tool
2. **Analyze against the checklist** below
3. **Output findings** in the standard format

## Review Checklist

### Idiomatic Patterns
- Uses pipeline operator (`|>`) for data transformations
- Pattern matching is exhaustive (no catch-all `_` when specific cases should be handled)
- Prefers pattern matching over nested conditionals
- Uses `use` expressions appropriately for callbacks and resource management
- Avoids deeply nested expressions

### Result/Option Handling
- No silent error swallowing (e.g., `result.unwrap` without good reason)
- Errors propagate with meaningful context
- Uses `result.try` or `use` for chaining fallible operations
- Option types used for optional values, not Result
- Early returns via pattern matching for error cases

### Module Organization
- Public functions (`pub fn`) form a clear, minimal API
- Private helper functions are truly internal
- Related functionality grouped in same module
- Module names reflect their purpose
- Avoids circular dependencies

### Naming Conventions
- Functions use `snake_case`
- Types use `PascalCase`
- Module names use `snake_case`
- Names are descriptive but not overly verbose
- Boolean functions/fields prefixed appropriately (e.g., `is_valid`, `has_items`)

### Type Design
- Custom types preferred over tuples for domain concepts
- Variant types model states explicitly (avoid stringly-typed code)
- Opaque types used to hide implementation details when appropriate
- Type aliases used sparingly and meaningfully

### Code Clarity
- Functions are focused (single responsibility)
- Complex logic has explanatory comments
- No dead code or unused imports
- Consistent formatting

## Output Format

Present findings as:

```markdown
## Findings

### [SEVERITY] Issue Title
**File:** `path/to/file.gleam:LINE`
**Category:** quality

**Issue:** Description of what's wrong and why it matters.

**Suggestion:** How to fix, with code example if helpful.

**Effort:** trivial|small|medium|large

---
```

Use severity indicators:
- HIGH: Bugs, incorrect behavior, serious maintainability issues
- MEDIUM: Non-idiomatic code, unclear patterns, missing error handling
- LOW: Style issues, minor improvements, optional enhancements

## Summary

After all findings, provide:
- Total count by severity
- Top 2-3 priority items to address
- Overall code quality assessment (1-2 sentences)
